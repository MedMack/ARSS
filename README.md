#ARSS (Augmented Reality Solar System)

Not like any AR astronomy app you tried before, this one is Web friendly and only needs your browser to run.

## Overview
This project :
 - Is using the awesome [awe.js](https://github.com/buildar/awe.js) to make Augmented Web applications.
 - Doesn't need any installation :D Just check this [link](medmack.github.io/ARSS) with your mobile/tablet device (Firefox and Chrome are recommended)
 - Is for fun : I woke up someday with the idea of making a Web version of Google SkyMap, I welcome any contribution and/or ideas.
